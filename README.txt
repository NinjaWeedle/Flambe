== 1. DESCRIPTION ==

Flambé is a WarioWare-inspired set of minigames with one unifying theme: heat.
In this game, you'll need to stop ovens from overheating, Start a fire, and all sorts of other
activities in order to keep up a steady burn. Of course, if you want to get a good
score, you'll have to master controlling your calculator.

Can you take the heat?


== 2. SETTING UP THE GAME ==

-NOTICE FOR TI-84+ CSE/CE USERS-
Due to the lack of Celtic III libraries on the
TI-84 Plus C Silver Edition or the TI-84 Plus CE, I have made part of this
game functional without needing to have Celtic III installed. Note that I
said functional, not playable. The larger screen size of the CSE/CE means
that many parts of the game will display incorrectly which may or may not
make the game unplayable. Because of this, I must stress the following:

IF POSSIBLE, DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME ON A TI-84+ CSE OR A TI-84+ CE. IT WAS NOT
DESIGNED FOR THESE CALCULATORS, OUTSIDE OF PREVENTING THE PROGRAM FROM CRASHING
WHEN RUN ON THEM. THIS GAME WAS DESIGNED FOR THE MONOCHROME TI-84+ ONLY.

With that out of the way, let's proceed to...

-SETUP-
1. Send FLAMBE.8xp to RAM(Or archive if you plan on using a shell like Mirage OS or DoorsCS7)
2. Send CELTIC 3.8xk to Archive, then run the Celtic III app and Celtic III.
	-DoorsCS7 users should skip this step and instead enable Celtic III libraries in the DCS7 menu.
3. Run prgmFLAMBE.


== 3. HOW TO PLAY ==

- Navigating the menus -
Navigating the menus is nothing out of the ordinary- Use the arrow keys to navigate,
and press ENTER to select an option.

- General minigame controls -
Most minigames use 2nd and the arrow keys. The exceptions are minigames in which
you have to type, like in the minigame "TI-81". In this case, type like you normally
would in TI-OS, and press ENTER to submit your answer.
